# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Survey-Data
The problem at hand is to analyze the comments using text mining technique by building a sentiment analysis model in R. 
We had received positive, negative and neutral comments. Below is a sample of comments.
•	I would like to see more discussion on case studies, recommended practices, etc. regarding how best to structure the data analytics teams, how to set-up metrics for the performance of the data analytics teams, etc.
•	Excellent training!
•	Maybe sending out a more detailed list of functions to cover so that we could have digested them ahead of time.
•	The course material was perfect. Topic details, test cases then detailed descriptions of how to complete the case.
•	The course was great! Thank you!
My goal is to determine which course was the most popular and got the best feedback at the summit.
